                <strong>What is the Macy’s Style Crew?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                The Macy’s Style Crew is a new “social selling” initiative that enables our corporate and Stores employees to act as Macy’s ambassadors by creating and sharing shoppable videos or pictures to their social networks. Macy’s Style Crew is comprised of passionate and entrepreneurial participants who want to create unique, authentic content, and who want to build their social media presence and get rewarded for their impact. Check out #macysstylecrew on Facebook, Instagram and YouTube for some examples.

                <strong>What is a “shoppable video”?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                Imagine seeing a video featuring that awesome bag you’ve wanted forever on someone’s social media page. Now imagine being able to simply click on the video and buy the bag immediately on Macys.com. That is what we’re working towards.

                <strong>How does it work?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                Simple! Think of it in 3 easy steps:
                </p>
                <p className="term-item">
                    <span>•   </span><span>Take a photo / video</span>
                </p>
                <p className="term-item">
                    <span>•   </span><span>Upload and tag that photo / video through the MSC Portal</span>
                </p>
                <p className="term-item">
                    <span>•   </span><span>Share on social media using #macysstylecrew</span>
                </p>

                <p>

                We will have trainings for major topics, skills, etc. that will be relevant to you as a Macy’s Style Crew member.

However, this program is a great opportunity for you to let your entrepreneurial spirit shine, and take the initiative to figure out what moves the needle in developing your social presence and engaging your audience (since everyone’s will be a bit different).
