    "description": "I love getting a little dressed up for sunday outings with friends. Usually that means a good brunch with a few mimosas and a ton of laughs! Today I wore this City Chic lace dress with my favorite INC scalloped heels in Rose Gold with a fun clear heel! I also threw on some INC earrings for a little pop of pink and gold.",
