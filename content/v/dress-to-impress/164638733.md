    "description": "Dress the Part\nI believe in the saying, \"Dress to Impress\" no matter what the occasion is.  It's a reflection of your self worth.  For example, if you attend a job interview you dress like you already have the job.  By taking a few extra steps in the morning can change your whole attitude.  You look good, you feel good. \nBlog: www.chenayscorner.me",
