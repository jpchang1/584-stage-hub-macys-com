    "description": "I am a summer baby & a beach girl, so I am all about Macy's summer trend, The Great Escape! Curated by yours truly with a little extra love from the Herald Square visual team. :) Love all of these products, but my absolute fave is the Villeroy & Boch 3-tier stand. Our marketing team has used this in literally EVERYTHING - perfect for entertaining & the stand folds flat for easy storage!",
