    "description": "New shoes, new shoes!! Summer is almost here and all my old warm weather shoes just were not cutting it anymore - no place puts shoes to the test like NYC. Soo, while Macy's is having one of their awesome shoes sales, 40% off when you buy two or more pairs, I decided to follow my favorite phrase from Parks & Rec- Treat Yo Self! So excited to take these puppies for a spin around the city! \n\nSale ends 6\/19 - don't miss out!",
