    "description": "Hey Guys! This is my go to summer look whether I'm rushing to work or I just feel like wearing light makeup. The IT Cosmetics leaves a dewy finish so some days I want that look and some days I want to look more matte so that is where the Laura Mercier Translucent Loose Setting Powder comes in! The bye-bye under eye by IT Cosmetics is truly amazing ! I am so happy I found it! It brightens up your face with very little. Lets not forget about the brows. I mean how amazing is the ABH Brow Wiz!\nThank you for watching!\nxoxo\nAdri",
